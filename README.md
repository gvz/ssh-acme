# SSH Certificate Authority

This project provides a self-hosted SSH Certificate Authority (CA), similar in spirit to Let's Encrypt but for SSH certificates. Machines and users connect to this server over SSH to obtain short-lived, automatically renewable SSH certificates — replacing long-lived static keys.

## Setup Guide

See **[Setup Guide](documentation/setup.md)** for a full walkthrough: prerequisites, building, key generation, configuration, running the server, and requesting your first certificate.

## Features

- **SSH Certificate Authority:** A built-in CA that signs SSH public keys into user or host certificates.
- **Pluggable Authentication:** Supports different authentication methods for users requesting certificates (currently PAM). `root` is explicitly blocked.
- **Host Certificate Signing:** Hosts authenticate with their public key (verified against a pre-registered inventory) and receive a signed host certificate.
- **Unix Socket IPC:** The SSH server and CA server communicate over a Unix socket for secure inter-process communication.
- **Configurable:** Configured via TOML files for SSH server settings, CA settings, and per-user certificate templates.
- **Dynamic User Templates:** User certificate templates are rendered with [MiniJinja](https://docs.rs/minijinja) (Jinja2-compatible), allowing flexible principal and extension management per user.

## Client Scripts

The `clients/` directory contains two Bash scripts for requesting certificates from the CA.

**Sign a user certificate** (run on the user's workstation):

```bash
ssh-ca-sign-user-key.sh -s ca-server.example.com
```

**Sign a host certificate** (run on the managed host, as root):

```bash
sudo ssh-ca-sign-host-key.sh -s ca-server.example.com --reload
```

Both scripts support `--help` for the full option list. See [documentation/setup.md](documentation/setup.md) for installation instructions and all options.

## How It Works

### User Certificate Flow

1. A user connects to the SSH Certificate Authority server with their **username and password**.
2. The server authenticates the user against the configured identity handlers (e.g. PAM). `root` is always rejected.
3. On success, the user sends their **SSH public key** as channel data (stdin).
4. The SSH server forwards a `SignCertificate` request to the CA server over the Unix socket.
5. The CA looks up the user's certificate template (falling back to the default template), renders it, and signs the public key.
6. The signed certificate is returned to the user over the same SSH channel.

### Host Certificate Flow

1. A host connects to the SSH Certificate Authority server using **public key authentication**, presenting its host public key.
2. The server checks the CA's host inventory for a matching public key entry. If no match is found, the connection is rejected.
3. The host sends the `sign_host_key` command over the exec channel.
4. The SSH server forwards a `SignHostCertificate` request to the CA server.
5. The CA verifies the public key against the host's inventory entry and signs it.
6. The signed host certificate is returned to the host over the same SSH channel.
